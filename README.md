# About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering undergraduate focused on software development. I’m currently building real-world projects while expanding my knowledge in:

- Web development (Frontend & Backend)
- 3D visualization with **Three.js**
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Mobile development
- Networking and system fundamentals

I enjoy understanding how technologies work under the hood and applying that knowledge to create useful and well-structured applications.

# Projects

Some examples of what I’ve been working on:

- **[Stoichiometry Web App](https://github.com/snt94/stoichiometry-webapp)** – A chemistry-focused application that checks and balances chemical equations automatically.
- **[3D Concrete Block Simulator](https://github.com/snt94/a3-reinforcedConcrete)** – Built with **Three.js**, includes interactive sliders to simulate corrosion and material degradation.

Feel free to explore the repositories to see how I work and learn.
